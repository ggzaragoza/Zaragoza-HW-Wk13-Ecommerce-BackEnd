# Zaragoza-HW-Wk13-Ecommerce-BackEnd

This repository is an exercise in using the Sequelize package to input, add, and delete product info from a simulated database for an e-commerce site, using a code-first approach rather than SQL-oriented programming. The various HTTP routes for each model table in the database were tested locally via Insomnia Core. The routes may be forked from this repository and tested by running an npm install in your own local folder.
